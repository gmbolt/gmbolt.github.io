# Biography

My academic journey began with a BSc in Mathematics at The University of Manchester, graduating in 2018. I then moved to Lancaster University to undertake a 4 year MRes+PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, as part of the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training. 

My research interests really began to develop during my MRes at Lancaster, where I became intrigued by network analysis[^1]. This led to me doing a couple of networks-related projects during the course of my masters; one looking at network-flow optimisation problems, and another focussing on community detection in social networks. This segued nicely into my PhD project with Elsevier, where I developed network-analytic methods applicable to their platform usage data (see more here).

Though I cut my teeth on network analysis, my interests have since broadened. Much of my work has been done from the Bayesian perspective, and so I have grown interest in Bayesian modelling and computation more widely. I also took a six-month intercalation from my PhD to undertake an industrial placement with Tesco, where I spent some time looking at reinforcement learning methods. This was pretty far removed from my PhD work, but has since become an interest of mine (though I would not presently call myself an expert). Finally, more recently I have become interested in applications of data-analytic methods in sport, with an ambition to be involved with such work.  

Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching sport, rugby being the sport of choice, closely followed by golf. I also enjoy reading and playing guitar (badly).

[^1]: Network analysis can mean different things to different people. I have done work mostly on what is often called "statistical network analysis" where the network is itself the observed data (e.g. social network data), see [this review](https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/entities/publication/a05ccec2-4707-459c-b86d-ce2683617493/details) by Salter-Townshend et al.
