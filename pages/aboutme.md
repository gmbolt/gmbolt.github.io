This personal site mostly contains references to work done during my PhD, which I undertook as part of the [STOR-i center for doctoral training at Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/), graduating in 2024. 

To date, my research has touched upon statistical network analysis, Bayesian statistics, computational statistics (particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) and unsupervised learning.
