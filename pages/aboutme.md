# Biography

My academic journey began with a BSc in Mathematics at The University of Manchester, graduating in 2018. I then moved to Lancaster University to undertake a 4 year MRes+PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, as part of the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training. 

My research interests really began to develop during my MRes at Lancaster, where I took interest in network analysis. This led to me doing a couple of networks-related projects, one looking at network-flow optimisation problems, and another focussing on community detection in social networks.
