# Biography

I have an academic background in mathematics, starting with a BSc in Mathematics at The University of Manchester (graduating in 2018), before moving to Lancaster University to undertake a 4 year MRes+PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, as part of the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training. 

During my MRes at Lancaster my research interests swayed towards network analysis.[^1] This led to me doing a couple of networks-related projects during the course of my masters; one looking at network-flow optimisation problems, and another focussing on community detection in social networks. This segued nicely into my PhD project with Elsevier, where I developed network-analytic methods applicable to their platform usage data (see more [here](/pages/phd)).

Though I cut my teeth on network analysis, my interests have since broadened. Much of my work has been done from the Bayesian perspective, and so I have grown interest in Bayesian modelling and computation more widely. I also took a six-month intercalation from my PhD to undertake an industrial placement with Tesco, where I spent some time looking at reinforcement learning methods. 

More recently, I have taken interest in data-analytic methods within sports, and as of summer 2023 hold a role as a Quantitative Analyst at Smartodds, part of which involves research into sports modelling. 

[^1]: Network analysis can mean different things to different people. I have done work mostly on what is often called "statistical network analysis" where the network is itself the observed data (e.g. social network data), see [this review](https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/entities/publication/a05ccec2-4707-459c-b86d-ce2683617493/details) by Salter-Townshend et al. (2012).
