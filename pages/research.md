rss = "A short description of the page which would serve as **blurb** in a `RSS` feed; you can use basic markdown here but the whole description string must be a single line (not a multiline string). Like this one for instance. Keep in mind that styling is minimal in RSS so for instance don't expect maths or fancy styling to work; images should be ok though: ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Rick_and_Morty_opening_credits.jpeg)"
